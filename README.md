This is the repo for EddySchedules(one of many working titles). Eddy is an application for shift workers,
whether in the restaurant industry or one of many industries where shifts revolve and schedules aren't always the same.
Eddy's being built first as an ASP.NET MVC application to be hosted on the internet for free use. Shortly after, it will be developed across
multiple mobile platforms to provide users with a downloadable app that matches the websites capabilities.
